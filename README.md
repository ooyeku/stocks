# Julia Stock Analysis

This project demonstrates how to analyze stock market trends using Julia and the [YFinance.jl](https://github.com/sygwer/YFinance.jl) package. The main script fetches stock data for a given ticker, computes a simple moving average, and plots the results.

2. Bollinger Bands: This is a volatility indicator that measures the price volatility by calculating the standard deviation of the price.
3. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): This is a momentum oscillator that measures the difference between two moving averages.
4. Volume Analysis: Incorporate volume data to provide insights into the trading volume.
5. Stochastic Oscillator: This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and direction of price changes.
